---
These are the games we created with a group of students for software engineering. We had the chance to learn and understand more about classes, functions, and loops. We applied the principles of polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction in our programs.

Every game was created for us, and we could implement very little code by our professors when we needed help. There are different games and each one of them was built in python. There is a README file in every game to understand the game's purpose, instructions, organization, and requirements.
