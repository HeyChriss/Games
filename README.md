# Games 


# Purpose
---
These are the games we were able to create in a group of people in a class. 
We had the chance to learn and understand more about classes, functions and loops. We applied the principles 
of polymorphisim, inheritance, encapsulation and abstraction in our programs. 

Every game was created for us and we were able to implement very few code by our professors when we needed help. 
There are different games and each one of them was built in python. There is a README file in every game to understand
what the purpose of the game is, instructions, organization and requirements.
